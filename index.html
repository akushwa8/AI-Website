        <p>The music industry has been struggling with how to manage AI-generated content. Many musicians are now fearful of losing revenue as AI tools are capable of creating songs with little to no human input. This has sparked debates over copyright infringement and what constitutes real art versus AI-generated creations. The fear is that AI could outpace real human creativity, leading to unfair advantages for individuals exploiting the technology.</p>

        <p>The legal and ethical aspects of AI-generated music are under intense scrutiny. Streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music have clear policies prohibiting the use of bots for artificial streams. However, as AI technology improves, it becomes more difficult for these platforms to detect fraudulent streams, creating loopholes that malicious actors can exploit. The indictment against Smith could set a precedent for future cases where AI is used inappropriately to manipulate digital platforms.</p>
